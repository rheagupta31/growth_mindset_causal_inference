# üéì Estimating the Causal Impact of a Growth Mindset Intervention on Student Achievement

This project explores the effectiveness of a **growth mindset intervention** using synthetic student data inspired by the **National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM)**. It applies robust **causal inference techniques** including:

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
- Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)

These methods help estimate the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** of the intervention on academic performance.

## üìä Methods Overview

- **OLS Regression**: Controls for covariates directly.
- **1:1 Propensity Score Matching**: Pairs treated and untreated units with similar characteristics.
- **Inverse Probability Weighting**: Reweights samples to simulate a randomized trial.
- **Causal Validity Checks**: Covariate balance (via SMD plots), propensity score overlap, ignorability assumption.

---

## üß† Key Findings

- The intervention yields a **positive, significant ATE (~+0.41)** across all methods.
- Covariate balance and positivity assumptions are satisfied.
- The intervention appears **robust and scalable**, though contextual factors amplify its effectiveness across schools.
